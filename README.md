# BlockChain
Every year we are witnessing a lot of data being falsified, entering the biased data instead of the right data. In general, factories try to modify the data to avoid paying huge fines and getting shut down from the government.

<br>And this is not only about the money, but this project might also help to get a solution to people who are suffering from dust and pollution in the air. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 4.6 million people die each year from causes directly attributable to air pollution. For this death, one of the reasons is data modification. If the data was modified, we don’t know the actual data, and we trust that those areas are good, and we did not concentrate on those areas to avoid air pollution. On the other side, those areas are filling with more and more dust.

<br>Using Blockchain Technology can help us to overcome these kinds of problems in the air quality monitoring system. With this technology in the air quality monitoring system, nobody can change the actual data of air which is will be stored in the database. So, the blockchain is used as a database here with a web-based application front-end interface. The application shows the hourly air quality data reports and daily data graphical representations. It also allows authorized users to add new air quality data. All users can also view and validate the blockchain. The application is developed using Spring Tool Suite (STS) for user interface and back-end coding and MySQL as the database.
